# Information :
This project is implement in python and showcases OOPS concept namely abstraction, encapsulation, inheritance and exception handling. 

# Direction of Use:
- python -m tictactoe <absolute_path_to_filename>. Please refer #RULES for more details.

# To Run Tests:
- python -m unittest discover -s "./tests" <absolute_path_to_tests_folder> -p "test_*.py"

# NOTE: 
Use "py" in place of "python" in above commands for venv 3.10.

# RULES:
Minimum 1 player is required to play a game. If there is no 2nd player, Computer by default will become the 2nd player.
    There are 9 slots in a 3X3 format, available to be filled.
    The Player1 starts the game and each player will get the chance alternatively.
    These slots can be filled vertically, horizontally or diagonally and in any order.
    The game ends when:
        1. A player fills 3 consecutive slots with his Symbol, hence with a decisive result : Win/Lose.
        2. There are no more slots to be filled, hence a Draw.

# Problem Statement
Part A: Write a program that lets two players play tic-tac-toe with each other.
Board: The program starts with the empty grid. 
Players: Player one chooses the symbol (options: X and O) she likes to play with. Player two is automatically assigned the other symbol. 
Turn: A playerâ€™s turn is completed when she chooses the right slot on the grid. On an invalid input, ask the user to re-enter the correct slot. 
The game ends when there is no more move to make or a player has scored a sequence (3 slots in a row, column or a diagonal). 
Consider this as version v1.0 for your program.

Part B: Modify the program that allows players to play against a computer.
The Player will always go first and the computer will play second.
